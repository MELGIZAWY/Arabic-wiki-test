Gunbot is sold through a number of approved [resellers](https://github.com/GuntharDeNiro/BTCT/wiki/Resellers), who have their own support channels to make sure you are helped when you have questions about using the software.


The list of approved [resellers](https://github.com/GuntharDeNiro/BTCT/wiki/Resellers) is continuously kept up to date.




## How does it work?
